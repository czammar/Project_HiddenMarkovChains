Dear Marco Julio, Cesar, Nicolas and Sebastian

You have been assigned to give a talk on the "Markov Model and Hidden Markov Model". Here are two good refs you shall use:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-410-principles-of-autonomy-and-decision-making-fall-2010/lecture-notes/MIT16_410F10_lec20.pdf

Feel free to use other refs, but you must cover the material in these two lectures.


Some quick points regarding your project:

 

1- This is teamwork so you both will get the same mark. Do your best! In other words, I will evaluate your team, not individuals.

 

2- You have almost 1 hr and 10 mins to give your talk. It is up to you to split the work between yourselves. All must give a talk and knows all the materials.


NOV. 07 @ 16:00-17:10

 

Please send your presentation (in the Beamer or the PowerPoint) to me a couple of days, before your presentation. 

 

Best,

Nasser
